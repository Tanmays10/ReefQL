### Some behind the scenes

This project was originally ideated by [Chitrash](https://github.com/Calm-Rock) that there is a need for reef's native GraphQL IDE for developers working on reef chain so we can provide some features to them.

So created in 4 days this is my first project using React, GraphQL, WEB3 and Reef.

Further works (Future Versions):
- Dashboard for analytics with reef on-chain data.
- Developer focused features in ReefQL IDE.
- Intergration with further data endpoints of reef chain.
- Connect with SubSquid Archive for reef.


Got to learn so much throughout the project ❤️
